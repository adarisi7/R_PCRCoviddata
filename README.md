# R_PCRCoviddata
PCR analysis on Covid Data
## Analysis
For this project, our group worked on explaining the in-depth process of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) through Covid Data in New Jersey. We used real world data to demonstrate how to code the operation in R and how we interpreted it. Moreover, we explained the complexities of PCA by defining and illustrating specific terminology that forms its framework. This included elements such as graphical analysis, eigenvalues and eigenvectors, plots, and principal components. We did this by using examples, consisting of R codes and graphs,  to properly depict each component. We ended with showing our results and outputs from our code to give a clear understanding of what it should look like, as well as some questions for thought.
